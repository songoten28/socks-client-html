<h1>SimpleSSHD</h1>

<p>SimpleSSHD is an SSH2 server based on dropbear that supports scp,
    sftp, and rsync.  It only supports public-key based authentication (no
    password/interactive auth except for bootstrapping).  It does not use
    root, which means it must listen on a port over 1024 (defaults to port
    2222).</p>

<h2>Quick start</h2>

<ul>
    <li> Install SimpleSSHD.
    </li><li> On any computer which will connect to your Android device, set the
    port to 2222.  With OpenSSH, this can be done by putting these lines in
    <tt>~/.ssh/config</tt>:
    <pre>Host myphone
Port 2222
</pre>
</li><li> Launch SimpleSSHD, and in Settings enable "Start on Boot", then
    manually start it for the first time.
</li><li> Create <tt>authorized_keys</tt> in the home directory
    (do not use <tt>ssh-copy-id</tt>).
</li><li> Optionally run <tt>restorecon -F authorized_keys</tt> (LineageOS
    needs it for "SELinux context").
</li><li> Optionally make <tt>.profile</tt>.
</li></ul>

<p>If SimpleSSHD does not find an <tt>authorized_keys</tt> file when a
    client connects, then it generates a single-use password at that time and
    displays it in the console log.  So the procedure to login the first time
    is to initiate the ssh connection, then look at the phone and type in the
    password that is on the screen in the SimpleSSHD app.  It is recommended
    to use that shell session to install the <tt>authorized_keys</tt>
    file.</p>

<p>Once <tt>authorized_keys</tt> exists, only public key authentication
    is supported.  If you screw up your <tt>authorized_keys</tt> file, use
    the options menu (upper right) -&gt; Reset Keys.</p>

<p>The default home directory is now the app-private directory, which
    will generally be something like
    <tt>/data/data/org.galexander.sshd/files</tt>, but may vary depending on
    your device.  Use options menu -&gt; Copy App-private Path to view the path
    or copy it onto the clipboard.  A nice feature of the app-private
    directory is it generally supports the full range of Unix file
    permissions, including execute!  A disadvantage is that these files all
    disappear if you uninstall SimpleSSHD.</p>

<p>Once you get setup, you may want BusyBox.  Check out
    <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.galexander.busybox">SimpleBusyBox</a>.</p>


<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>Generally speaking, you must re-start the SimpleSSHD service for any
    of these settings to take effect.</p>

<dl>
    <dt>Start on Boot</dt>
    <dd>Automatically start the SimpleSSHD service when the phone powers on.</dd>

    <dt>Start on Open</dt>
    <dd>Run the SimpleSSHD service whenever the app is launched.  The "STOP"
        button will be replaced with a "QUIT" button that stops the service and
        exits the app.  This is useful if you want to only run the service when
        you really need it -- start the app to start listening for connections,
        and then click "QUIT" when you are done.</dd>

    <dt>Foreground Service</dt>
    <dd>Run the SimpleSSHD service as an Android "foreground service." This
        means a notification will be displayed for the service (you might be able
        to block the notification by long tapping the notification).
        On newer versions of Android (since Marshmallow), this may also make
        SimpleSSHD more responsive if the phone has been in Doze mode.  It does
        not seem to increase battery consumption much.</dd>

    <dt>Port Number</dt>
    <dd>This is the port number that SimpleSSHD will listen on.  It must be
        greater than 1024 (because SimpleSSHD does not have root).</dd>

    <dt>Buffer hack for rsync+SuperSU</dt>
    <dd>A bug in SuperSU interacts with an infelicity in rsync to cause an
        occasional deadlock.  This is a real pain because I use SuperSU+rsync
        for system-wide backups, which will always eventually trigger the
        deadlock.  To work around this, there is a "Buffer hack" option that
        should be enabled if you use rsync with SuperSU.  It adds a miniscule
        overhead to rsync, but isn't harmful even if you aren't using
        SuperSU.</dd>

    <dt>Extra Commandline</dt>
    <dd>You can specify additional commandline options for dropbear server.
        The options which are hardcoded are:
        <blockquote><pre>-R -F -p :portno</pre></blockquote>
        You can use <tt>\</tt> or <tt>"</tt> to escape characters in this
        commandline.</dd>

    <dt>Environment Variables</dt>
    <dd>You can specify environment variables to define before executing the
        shell.  There is one variable per line, with a
        "<em>name</em><tt>=</tt><em>value</em>" format.
        A common use would be
        "<tt>ENV=/data/data/org.galexander.sshd/files/.profile</tt>",
        if your device has a
        build of <tt>mksh</tt> that does not execute a <tt>.profile</tt>
        automatically.</dd>

    <dt>SSH Path</dt>
    <dd>Path for general dropbear files, which now defaults to
        the app-private directory (usually something like
        <tt>/data/data/org.galexander.sshd/files</tt>).
        Most importantly, this is where
        <tt>authorized_keys</tt> is found.  It is also where host keys wind up
        (they are created on demand), and where temporary files go.  Other than
        the app-private directory, it may go under <tt>/sdcard</tt>.</dd>

    <dt>Home Directory</dt>
    <dd>The login shell's home directory, which also defaults
        to the app-private directory.
        This is where your ssh session starts out, and is where <tt>.profile</tt>
        will be found if it is present.</dd>

    <dt>Login Shell</dt>
    <dd>Path to the command shell.  The default Android shell is
        <tt>/system/bin/sh</tt>, but you may prefer to use the one that comes with
        busybox or whatever.  If you set it to the su binary (i.e.,
        <tt>/system/xbin/su</tt>, or maybe <tt>/su/bin/su</tt>),
        then scp, sftp, and rsync will run as root and
        should be able to access files outside of <tt>/sdcard</tt>.  If the name
        of the shell contains "<tt>su</tt>" in it, instead of putting
        "<tt>-</tt>" before <tt>argv[0]</tt> to indicate the login shell,
        SimpleSSHD puts "<tt>-</tt>" as <tt>argv[1]</tt>.  That is, a regular
        login shell would be invoked as "<tt>-sh</tt>", but su will be invoked as
        "<tt>su -</tt>".</dd>


    <h2>Broadcast intents</h2>

    <p>SimpleSSHD registers receivers for broadcasts that you can use to
        start/stop the service programmatically, using an app like Tasker, or the
        commandline tool <tt>am</tt>.</p>

    <p>action: <tt>org.galexander.sshd.START</tt><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;or: <tt>org.galexander.sshd.STOP</tt><br>
        app: <tt>org.galexander.sshd</tt><br>
        category: <tt>android.intent.category.DEFAULT</tt> (optional).</p>

    <p>Note that these intents will only work on phones with Android 8 (Oreo)
        or later if <b>Settings</b> -&gt; <b>Foreground Service</b> is enabled.</p>

    <p>For example, to start sshd service under shell, you could run:
    </p><pre>am broadcast -a org.galexander.sshd.START org.galexander.sshd</pre><p></p>

    <p>You may need to specify <tt>--user 0</tt> depending on the context:
    </p><pre>am broadcast --user 0 -a org.galexander.sshd.START org.galexander.sshd</pre><p></p>

    <p>And if Android is ignoring your broadcasts because the app was never started yet (or was force stopped), you may try (it's all arbitrary to me!):
    </p><pre>am broadcast --user 0 -a org.galexander.sshd.START org.galexander.sshd/.StartReceiver</pre><p></p>


    <p>If you are getting an error from <tt>am</tt> like:
    </p><pre>cmd: Failure calling service activity: Failed transaction (2147483646)</pre>
    it can probably be solved by disassociating <tt>am</tt> from the ssh
    terminal (I don't know why).  This can be accomplished by redirecting
    stdin, stdout, and stderr.  For example, I can actually stop sshd from
    within an ssh session using this command:
    <pre>am broadcast --user 0 -a org.galexander.sshd.STOP org.galexander.sshd &lt; /dev/null &gt; /dev/null 2&gt; /dev/null</pre><p></p>


    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <p>Here are some common complaints:</p>

    <ul>
        <li> Writing to an SD card is not generally possible -- your mileage may
            vary.  Modern Android (since about Kit Kat) only allows write access to
            an SD card through the Android Java API, but shell commands usually use
            Unix APIs (POSIX, C).  I don't know a work-around.  Most phones let you
            write to <tt>/sdcard</tt>, but it's often in the phone's internal memory.

        </li><li>If you installed an <tt>authorized_keys</tt> file, but SimpleSSHD
        acts like it doesn't exist, try running "<tt>restorecon -F
            authorized_keys</tt>".  Some Android configurations, such as LineageOS,
        run apps in an "SELinux Context" (don't ask me) where that kind of thing
        is necessary.

    </li><li> <tt>rsync</tt> will do too much work for an update, because there is
        usually no way to update the ctime, mtime, or atime on files in
        <tt>/sdcard</tt>.  Use <tt>rynsc --size-only</tt>, and it will compare
        the file sizes instead of the modification time.

    </li><li> For the same reason, <tt>rsync -a</tt> will generally fail.  Use
        <tt>rsync -r</tt> instead.

    </li><li> "<tt>Not backgrounding</tt>" is just the string that dropbear
        outputs when it isn't asked to <tt>fork()</tt> when it starts up -- it's
        harmless.

    </li><li> If you really must specify which IP to listen on, consider setting
        <b>Port Number</b> to 22 (which will fail and be ignored), and then add
        <tt>-p 192.168.1.123:2222</tt> to <b>Extra Commandline</b>.

    </li><li> Do not use <tt>ssh-copy-id</tt>, it will try to put the
        <tt>authorized_keys</tt> file in the wrong place.

    </li></ul>
